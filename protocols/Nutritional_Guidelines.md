This document provides the dietary "levers" required to achieve the GKI targets discussed in this research.

## Nutritional Intervention Guidelines

**Author:** Samuelson G.

**1. Macronutrient Ratios**

To achieve a GKI < 2.0, a **3:1 or 4:1 ketogenic ratio** is typically required.

- **Fat:** 80–90% of total calories (MCT oil, Avocado, Olive oil).
- **Protein:** 10–15% (Target 1.2g per kg of ideal body weight to prevent muscle wasting).
- **Carbohydrates:** <5% (Strictly non-starchy vegetables only).


## 2. The "Press-Pulse" Schedule

- **The Press (Constant):** Nutritional ketosis via the GKI protocol to provide chronic metabolic stress to tumor cells.
- **The Pulse (Intermittent):** * **Water Fasting:** 24–48 hours prior to chemotherapy or LIFU to maximize "Differential Stress Sensitization."
     - **Supplements:** High-dose Melatonin (20mg+) before bed to enhance glymphatic clearance.
