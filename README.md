## 📄 Abstract

Grade 4 Glioblastoma (GBM), specifically the IDH-wildtype variant, represents a primary challenge in neuro-oncology due to its infiltrative nature and therapy resistance. This research evaluates the clinical synergy between mechanical **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) disruption** via Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) and the implementation of **Therapeutic Ketogenic Diet (TKD).** By utilizing the **Glucose-Ketone Index (GKI),** we propose a framework to metabolically sensitize tumor cells to standard-of-care chemoradiation.

## 🧬 Key Research Areas

### 1. Molecular Pathogenesis

We analyze the 2026 WHO classification standards, focusing on:

- **IDH-wildtype vs. IDH-mutant**
- **MGMT Promoter Methylation** status as a chemotherapy predictor.
- **EGFR and TERT** promoter mutations.

### 2. Bypassing the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)

The BBB filters 98% of small-molecule drugs. This paper explores:
- **LIFU Technology:** Mechanical permeabilization of capillary junctions.
- **Nanoparticle Delivery:** Receptor-mediated transcytosis.

### 3. Metabolic Conditioning (The GKI Protocol)

Targeting the **Warburg Effect** to deprive tumor cells of glucose-driven ATP.

           *GKI = [Glucose (mg/dL) / 18] / [Ketones (mmol/L)]*
  
  **Target Range: 1.0 – 2.0**
  

## 🏁 Conclusion

The comprehensive management of Grade 4 Glioblastoma in 2026 requires a synchronized assault on the tumor's genetics, mechanical barriers, and metabolic fuel sources. As established in this review, the integration of precision physics (LIFU), molecular biology (Genomic sequencing), and therapeutic nutrition (GKI management) represents the most advanced frontier in neuro-oncology. Moving forward, the "Samuelson G. Protocol" suggests that shifting from a monotherapeutic approach to a multimodal metabolic conditioning paradigm offers the most statistically significant path for extending progression-free survival (PFS) and improving the quality of life for patients facing this formidable diagnosis.
